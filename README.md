# Welcome to my mini React app

**[Link to my live app](https://3782291211.github.io/responsive-react-SPA/)**

Hello, and welcome to my single-page React app!

This is a very simple app which allows a user to search for a song, preview some information about the track, view the album art, add songs to a playlist and remove them individually. The app sends GET requests through fetch API to retrieve the necessary information.

## Quick-start instructions
To see the app in action:
1. Click on the above link to the app (or use the link in the 'About' section of the main repository page).
2. In the app, type in a song name and artist name and click 'preview track details'. This will display the album art and song information for valid queries, or an error message for invalid requests.
3. Add songs to the playlist by clicking 'add to playlist'.
4. Remove songs from the playlist by clicking 'remove'.    


## App view
Here's a full view of the user interface (responsive on all typical viewports, and optimised for mobile and tablet).
